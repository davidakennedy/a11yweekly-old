# Accessibility Weekly

A weekly dose of web accessibility to help you bring it into your every day work. This is the website for the newsletter of the same name.

## Why?

I started this newsletter because I believe web workers should think about, talk about and practice accessibility differently. Anyone can make the Web more accessible one change at a time. That only happens if we share our knowledge, and this is one way I'm sharing mine.

## Inspiration and thanks

This wouldn't be possible without these great projects:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [HTML5 Bones](http://html5bones.com/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
